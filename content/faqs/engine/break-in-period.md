Honda recommends a **600-mile break-in period** for the Integra Type S.

## During Break-In

- Keep RPM below 4,000
- Vary engine speed — avoid holding constant RPM for extended periods
- Avoid hard braking when possible
- Do not use cruise control for long stretches

## After Break-In

After 600 miles, gradually increase RPM range over the next few hundred miles
before using the full rev range.
