<current_state>
Phase 1.1 (Set Up Styling) context discussion is COMPLETE. CONTEXT.md has been written and committed. Phase is ready for planning — no plans or execution have started yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Phase insertion: Created phase 1.1 directory, updated ROADMAP.md and STATE.md
- Context discussion: All four gray areas discussed (CSS framework, design direction, component styling, responsive strategy)
- CONTEXT.md written and committed (e6662f5): `.planning/phases/1.1-set-up-styling/1.1-CONTEXT.md`
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Plan the phase: Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1.1` to create PLAN.md with task breakdown
- Execute the phase plans once planning is complete
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- **Bulma + SCSS + PurgeCSS** as CSS framework (not Tailwind, Bootstrap, or plain CSS)
- **Type S red `#b81a35`** as primary accent (from acura.com image), with `#e82c2a` (CSS) and `#E40521` (community) as references for Phase 8 review
- **Clean/minimal** light mode, **warm neutral darks** for dark mode (no blue undertone)
- **Inter** font, self-hosted (no CDN)
- **Lucide** icons
- **Dark mode in this phase** — system preference default + manual toggle in nav bar
- **SCSS partials structure** — override Bulma variables directly
- **Comprehensive design tokens** (colors, spacing, borders, shadows, transitions)
- **Basic layout shell** (nav + main + footer) with hamburger menu on mobile
- **Mobile-first**, Bulma default breakpoints, 44px touch targets
- Bulma `.content` class configured for Nuxt Content markdown rendering
- Subtle transitions for hover states, dark mode toggle, page transitions
- Nuxt-style links (accent color, no underline, underline on hover)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — ready for planning.
</blockers>

<context>
All implementation decisions are captured in 1.1-CONTEXT.md. The user referenced nuxt.com and content.nuxt.com as design inspiration — generous whitespace, card-based modules, strong typography hierarchy, content-forward. The Type S red color was researched thoroughly: no official Acura hex exists, so we're using #b81a35 (sampled from acura.com image) with a Phase 8 checkpoint to revisit.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:plan-phase 1.1` to create the execution plan. CONTEXT.md has all decisions locked — the planner should not need to re-ask the user about framework, colors, or approach.
