<current_state>
Phase 1.1 (Set Up Styling) was just inserted into the roadmap as an urgent phase between Phase 1 (Foundation) and Phase 2 (Content System). No planning or execution has happened yet — this phase needs to be planned before any work begins.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Phase insertion: Created phase 1.1 directory, updated ROADMAP.md and STATE.md
- ROADMAP.md: Added Phase 1.1 to phase list, phase details, execution order, and progress table
- STATE.md: Updated current focus to Phase 1.1, added Roadmap Evolution section
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Plan the phase: Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1.1` to define goals, success criteria, and task breakdown
- Execute the phase plans once planning is complete
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Inserted as Phase 1.1 (decimal phase) to avoid renumbering the entire roadmap
- Phase 2 (Content System) now implicitly follows Phase 1.1 in execution order
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — ready for planning.

<context>
User requested styling setup be inserted as urgent work before Phase 2 (Content System). This makes sense because having styling infrastructure in place before building content display pages (Phase 2-3) avoids rework. The phase description is intentionally broad ("set up styling") — the planning step will define specific scope.

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:plan-phase 1.1` to define what "set up styling" means concretely — goals, success criteria, and task breakdown. Consider what styling tools/frameworks to use (e.g., Tailwind, UnoCSS, plain CSS, etc.) and discuss with user before committing to an approach.
