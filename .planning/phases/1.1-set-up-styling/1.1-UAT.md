## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Bulma CSS Classes Render
expected: Navigate to http://localhost:3000. The homepage shows styled content: a navbar at top with "DE5.org" branding, a section area with title, and card-style boxes in a column layout. Elements have padding, rounded corners, and proper typography.
result: pass

### 2. Dark Mode Toggle
expected: In the navbar, there is a sun or moon icon button. Clicking it switches between light and dark mode. In light mode you see a moon icon (to switch to dark). In dark mode you see a sun icon (to switch to light). The entire page color scheme changes on toggle.
result: pass

### 3. Dark Mode Persists Across Refresh
expected: Toggle to dark mode, then refresh the page (Cmd+R). The page should reload in dark mode — it should not flash light then switch to dark. Your preference is remembered.
result: pass

### 4. Warm Neutral Dark Backgrounds
expected: In dark mode, the background color should be a warm neutral (dark gray/charcoal, roughly #171717). It should NOT have a blue or cool tint. Compare with a pure gray — the dark mode should feel warm, not cold.
result: pass

### 5. Inter Font Renders
expected: Text on the page should render in the Inter font (a clean, modern sans-serif). Check the browser dev tools (Inspect > Computed > font-family) — it should show "Inter" as the rendered font, loaded from a local/self-hosted source (no requests to fonts.googleapis.com or external CDNs).
result: pass

### 6. Responsive Navbar (Hamburger on Mobile)
expected: Resize your browser window to a narrow width (~375px) or use device emulation. The navbar should collapse: navigation links and the theme toggle move behind a hamburger icon (three horizontal lines). Tapping/clicking the hamburger reveals the menu items.
result: pass

### 7. SCSS Design Tokens in Components
expected: This is verified indirectly — the $type-s-red brand color (#E82C2A or similar red) should be visible as the primary/accent color on interactive elements (links, buttons, or highlights). If you see red accent colors on the page, the design tokens are working.
result: pass
