<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create legal terms/disclaimer page at /terms</name>
  <files>
    app/pages/terms.vue
  </files>
  <action>
    Create `app/pages/terms.vue` as a plain Vue page (not a Nuxt Content markdown file). The terms content is static legal text that rarely changes.

    Template (Pug):
    ```pug
    section.section
      .container
        .content
          h1.title Terms &amp; Disclaimer
          [legal content sections]
    ```

    Use Bulma `.content` class wrapper for automatic markdown-like typography (headings, paragraphs, lists).

    Content sections (formal/legal tone per locked decision):

    1. **Disclaimer** -- heading and body text explaining:
       - DE5.org aggregates community knowledge from forums, owner experiences, and public sources.
       - Content is not verified, endorsed, or guaranteed by DE5.org, Acura, Honda, or any manufacturer.
       - Information is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
       - Use at your own risk. Always consult official service manuals and qualified professionals.

    2. **Source Attribution** -- explanation that:
       - FAQ answers include source links to original forum posts and discussions.
       - Source links may become outdated or broken over time.
       - DE5.org is not affiliated with the original sources.

    3. **Not Professional Advice** -- statement that:
       - Content does not constitute professional mechanical, legal, or financial advice.
       - Modifications and maintenance should be performed by qualified professionals.
       - DE5.org is not liable for any damages resulting from use of information on this site.

    4. **Community Content** -- note that:
       - Information is crowdsourced and may contain inaccuracies.
       - Users are encouraged to verify information independently.
       - If you find incorrect information, contact us (placeholder -- no email needed yet).

    5. **Trademarks** -- brief note:
       - Acura, Integra, and Type S are trademarks of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.
       - DE5.org is an independent community project and is not affiliated with Honda or Acura.

    Script:
    ```typescript
    useHead({ title: 'Terms & Disclaimer' })
    useSeoMeta({
      ogTitle: 'Terms & Disclaimer | DE5.org',
      ogDescription: 'Legal disclaimer and terms of use for DE5.org community knowledge hub.',
    })
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `yarn dev` and navigate to `/terms`. Verify:
    - Page renders with proper heading and all legal content sections.
    - Bulma `.content` provides clean typography for headings, paragraphs, and lists.
    - Page title in browser tab shows "Terms & Disclaimer".
    - Dark mode renders correctly.
    Run `yarn lint` -- no errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Legal terms/disclaimer page at /terms with formal/legal content covering disclaimer, source attribution, not-professional-advice, community content, and trademark notes.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance error page with FAQ-specific 404 handling</name>
  <files>
    app/error.vue
  </files>
  <action>
    Update `app/error.vue` to detect FAQ-specific 404s and show contextual messaging.

    The current error page shows generic "Page Not Found" for all 404s. Enhance it to:

    1. Detect if the error URL starts with `/faqs` (check `useRequestURL()` or the error object).
    2. For FAQ-specific 404s: show "This FAQ doesn't exist" with a link back to /faqs ("Browse all FAQs") in addition to the "Go back home" link.
    3. For general 404s: keep the existing "Page Not Found" message with "Go back home" link.
    4. For non-404 errors: keep the existing "Something Went Wrong" message.

    Template approach (Pug):
    ```pug
    NuxtLayout(name="minimal")
      .container
        .column.is-half.is-offset-one-quarter.has-text-centered
          //- FAQ-specific 404
          template(v-if="error?.statusCode === 404 && isFaqRoute")
            h1 FAQ Not Found
            p This FAQ doesn't exist or may have been removed.
            p
              NuxtLink.button.is-primary.mr-2(to="/faqs") Browse All FAQs
              NuxtLink.button.is-light(to="/") Go Home
          //- General 404
          template(v-else-if="error?.statusCode === 404")
            h1 Page Not Found
            p The page you are looking for does not exist.
            NuxtLink(to="/") Go back home
          //- Other errors
          template(v-else)
            h1 Something Went Wrong
            p An unexpected error occurred.
            NuxtLink(to="/") Go back home
    ```

    Script:
    - Compute `isFaqRoute` from the current URL. Use `useRequestURL()` to get the URL path and check if it starts with `/faqs`. Note: in SSG error pages, the URL may come from the error object or the request URL. Test both approaches.
    - Keep the existing `defineProps<{ error: NuxtError }>()`.

    Alternatively, a simpler approach: check `error.url` if available, or use `useRoute().path` -- but in error pages, the route might not reflect the errored URL. The most reliable approach for SSG is to check `error.url` or fall back to checking if the window location includes `/faqs`.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `yarn dev` and verify:
    - Navigate to `/faqs/nonexistent/path` -- shows "FAQ Not Found" with "Browse All FAQs" button and "Go Home" button.
    - Navigate to `/nonexistent` -- shows "Page Not Found" with "Go back home" link.
    - Dark mode renders correctly on error pages.
    Run `yarn lint` -- no errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Error page shows FAQ-specific 404 ("FAQ Not Found" with link to /faqs) for FAQ routes and generic 404 for other routes. Non-404 errors unchanged.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks:
1. `/terms` page renders with full legal disclaimer content.
2. FAQ 404s (e.g., `/faqs/nonexistent`) show "FAQ Not Found" with link to /faqs.
3. General 404s show standard "Page Not Found" message.
4. `yarn lint` passes.
5. `yarn generate` succeeds.

<success_criteria>
- /terms page exists with formal legal disclaimer content
- FAQ-specific 404s show contextual message with link to /faqs
- General 404s and other errors unchanged
- All pages work in both light and dark modes
</success_criteria>
